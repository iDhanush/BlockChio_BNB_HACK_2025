# **BlockChio — BNB Hackathon 2025**

**BlockChio** is an **AI agent workflow builder for blockchain** — a no-code platform inspired by **LangChain/LangFlow**, enhanced with **blockchain-native agents** and **on-chain agentic memory**.

Build automated blockchain workflows where **AI agents can reason, act, transact, and store persistent memory on-chain**.

---

## 🚀 Key Features

### **AI Agent Workflows (LangFlow-Style)**

Drag-and-drop nodes to create:

* AI reasoning chains
* Multi-agent systems
* Reactive event-driven flows

### **Blockchain-Native Agents**

* Contract calls
* Swaps, staking, transfers
* Event listeners
* Wallet signing & execution

### **On-Chain Agentic Memory**

Agents can store their state, preferences, and decisions directly **on-chain**, enabling:

* Long-term synchronization
* Verifiable agent behavior
* Persistent autonomous systems

### **On-chain + Off-chain Integration**

Connect blockchain primitives with:

* APIs
* Webhooks
* External apps
* IoT or Web2 services

## 📦 Tech Stack

* **Python** — Agent engine & AI logic
* **JavaScript** — Visual workflow builder
* **SCSS** — UI styling
* **Solidity** — On-chain memory & tools
